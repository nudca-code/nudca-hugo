[Barnes et al. 2016](/References/References/#Barnes2016) develop an analytic expression for time-dependent thermalization efficiencies of massive particles under the following assumptions:
 - The radioactive energygeneration rate evolves as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha = 1.0$ (close to the  expected values $\alpha = 1.1–1.4$);
 - The density in the ejecta is spatially uniform;
 - The energy-loss rates are independent of particle energy, and depend only on $\rho$;
 - All particles of a given type are emitted at a single energy $E_{0}$.

The thermalization efficiency is defined as the ratio of energy emitted by radioactive processes to energy absorbed by the ejecta at any time $t$,

$$
f_{th}(t) = \frac{\dot{E}_{th}(t)}{\dot{E}_{rad}(t)}
$$

In general, the thermalization fraction, $f_{th}$, is a time-dependent quantity that describes the fraction of energy that is absorbed by the ejecta from radioactive processes that includes fission fragments, α particles, β particles, and γ -rays. We assume that the total thermalization efficiency can be approximately described by [Barnes et al. 2016](/References/References/#Barnes2016)
$$
f_{th}(t) = 0.36 \left[\exp(-at) + \frac{\ln\left(1+2bt^{d}\right)}{2bt^{d}} \right]
$$

where $a$, $b$, and $d$ are fit coefficients. The fit coefficients are given in Table 1 of [Barnes et al. 2016](/References/References/#Barnes2016).
