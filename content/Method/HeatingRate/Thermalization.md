In general, the thermalization fraction, $f_{th}$, is a time-dependent quantity that describes the fraction of energy that is absorbed by the ejecta from radioactive processes that includes fission fragments, α particles, β particles, and γ -rays. We assume that the total thermalization efficiency can be approximately described by [Barnes et al. 2016](/References/References/#Barnes2016)
$$
f_{th}(t) = 0.36 \left[\exp(-at) + \frac{\ln\left(1+2bt^{d}\right)}{2bt^{d}} \right]
$$

where $a$, $b$, and $d$ are fit coefficients. The fit coefficients are given in Table 1 of [Barnes et al. 2016](/References/References/#Barnes2016).
